(For example, should we slow down when it is cloudy because there is less energy, or speed up because we might be able to make it through the storm and get sun on the other side). Besides weather, terrain including hills and curves is a major factor. Since we have the mathematical model for the solarcar available as well as weather and solar data from during previous year's races, I'm hoping to use reinforcement learning to create an optimized race strategy.

I am particularly interested in whether devices with heterogeneous computational capabilities can collaboratively train a model, similar to FL but without requiring identical architectures. I am also interested in whether neural network architectures can be dynamically shrunk or expanded while preserving learned knowledge, enabling adaptable training across changing resource constraints. There is a technique called neural net surgery, but it applies only for linear activation function. Developing/Exploring it's functionality on non linear activation functions will give us an understanding and might possibly lead to the development of a technique for changing a model's architecture. If we can shrink a model's architecture with same knowledge, we can compute the inference in less number of FLOPs leading to better efficiency."
